FakeDataGeneratorForSM
======================

Fake data generator for Simulator Manager project.

To use this project, import it into Eclipse. This is a simple Java GUI application using Swing. 

The program generates random data and writes it to a database. 

Update:
The application is kind of deprecated, because currently:
1) The simulator manager is able to retrieve data from X-Plane through AWCom directly
2) The database model has changed
3) For visualizing running simulations the Simulator Manager doesn't use data from database now, but instead, it uses data retrieved through AWCom
